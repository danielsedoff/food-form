food-form

This Food Form is a mobile friendly calorie calculator-ish tool.

It allows you to put down roughly the type of food, the meal
name, and the price of the food you have bought and eaten.
It saves your time, shows a neat table, and also stores
the data in a popular CSV format.

The default options are 'A giant portion of donuts' so you 
can't just press Send. You have to choose the real options.
Or on the rare occasion it is true, just press Send.
