Food-form

This Food Form is a mobile friendly Web calorie calculator.

It allows you to store the type of food, the meal name, and the price of the food you have bought and eaten.

It is quicker than most tools of its kind. It shows a log and stores the data in CSV which is good for downloading.

The default options are 'A giant portion of donuts' so you can't just press Send. You have to choose the real options.
